# Dice Roller on two 7-segment displays

For yall nerds out there who might also need some soldering practice. The finished product consists of an Arduino Nano, two Common Anode 7-segment displays, a button to initialise rolling, a potentiometer to choose dice and a whole load of resistors and wires! 

## About the project
This is a small personal project I made as a gift for a friend who plays D&D.
The goal was originally to create it with ATTiny and bit-shift registers as I wanted
more experience with different components and make it a compact product. But, after not
finding the components I wanted, I ended up trying to create it on the Arduino Nano instead. Rant over, here are the highlights of the project (imo)
* Uses Arduino Nano to control two 7-segment displays
* The function is to roll different dice(d6, d20 and d100) dependent on the state of a potentiometer
* Has some light animation to imitate the dice rolling
* Function based design to be easily expanded or changed :D

Feel free to steal or change anything about it! I personally found it to be quite a cool hobby project
