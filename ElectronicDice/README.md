# Dice Roller on two 7-segment displays

Add picture of result here

##About the project
This is a small personal project I made as a gift for a friend who plays D&D.
The goal was originally to create it with ATTiny and bit-shift registers as I wanted
more experience with different components and make it a compact product. But, after not
finding the components I wanted, I ended up trying to create it on the Arduino Nano instead. Rant over, here are the highlights of the project
* Uses Arduino Nano to control two 7-segment displays
* The function is to roll different dice(d6, d20 and d100) dependent on different button-presses
* Has some light animation to imitate the dice rolling
* Function based design to be easily expanded or changed
